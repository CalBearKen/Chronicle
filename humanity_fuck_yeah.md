📜 Title: "The Apple Don't Fall Far, But it Sure Can Roll Awful Strange"

🧐 Observation: 
It has come to my attention, through the electric scribblings of the Wonkette news journal, that white folks, as they say, are getting stranger by the day. Now, I'm not one to judge a man by the color of his skin, but by the peculiarities of his actions, and the actions of late have been downright peculiar. 

🤠 Tall Tales: 
This recent fascination with 'White folks getting stranger' reminds me of the time old Jeb Johnson decided to hitch his mule to the front of his Model T. It was a sight to behold, indeed. Jeb, in all his wisdom, had the notion that the stubbornness of the mule would somehow transfer over to the automobile, making it less prone to breakdowns. Well, all that resulted was a Model T with a bad case of the brays, and a mule with an even worse case of the exhaust.

Then there's this newfangled "Movie Night" that Wonkette's been promoting. They're screening a film called 'The Brother from Another Planet.' It's much like that fella who claimed he'd struck gold in his backyard, only to find out he'd been digging up his wife's buried biscuit tins. The excitement is palpable, the outcome, bewildering, and the biscuits, well, they're just downright confusing. 

🧙♂️ Moral: 
So life, my friends, is a lot like a mule hitched to a Model T, or a man digging for gold in a biscuit tin. It's a strange amalgamation of the unexpected, the unexplainable, and the downright bizarre. But isn't that the beauty of it all? For if we knew what to expect, we'd never have the joy of being surprised by a mule with exhaust problems, or the delight of unearthing a buried biscuit tin. And as for those white folks getting stranger, well, I reckon we're all a little strange in our own way. After all, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, but it sure can roll in some peculiar directions.

==============================
Title: "The Rooster's Crowing, But Ain't No Sunrise"

Observation:
Well, I'll be a mule's uncle if the world ain't gone topsy-turvy. It's as if we've all been invited to a barn dance, but the fiddle's playing backwards and the cows are calling the steps.

Tall Tales:
Take this yarn about a moneybags fool petitioning the Supreme Court to muddle libel laws, so he can sue folks easier. Reminds me of the time old Clem tried to put wheels on his henhouse to make the chickens lay eggs faster. Both are just as productive, and sure to leave you covered in feathers and regret. 

Then there's the Heritage Foundation, hootin' and hollerin' to have Prince Harry deported. Much like that fella who tried to drain the pond to catch a single catfish. You might get your fish, but you'll be left knee-deep in mud and with no place to wash your britches.

And don't get me started on the hullabaloo about Molasses Bar Day. Now I ain't one to turn down a sweet treat, but it seems to me like folks are making a mountain out of a molehill. Or, as my Pappy used to say, "trying to get blood from a turnip."

Moral:
So, what's the lesson here? Well, as my dear old granny used to say, "When the world goes mad, best to sit on the porch and whittle." In other words, sometimes the sanest response to a world gone haywire is to just sit back and laugh. Or as I like to put it, "If the rooster's crowing but ain't no sunrise, maybe it's the rooster that's got it wrong."

📜 Title: "As the Catfish Finds the Mud, So Do the Modern Folks Find Absurdity"

🧐 Observation:
It has been reported that big business is getting bigger, with corporate behemoths like Amazon and Honeywell splitting and spreading like a river after a heavy rain, and the discount store Tiendas 3B rising like a phoenix from the ashes of its initial public offering. It's enough to make a man scratch his head and wonder if the world has gone topsy-turvy.

🤠 Tall Tales:
Such corporate shenanigans remind me of the time Uncle Jed tried to split his hog farm into two separate entities - one for the pigs, and another for the mud. Thought he could double his profits that way. As it turned out, pigs without mud ain't worth a hill of beans and mud without pigs is just... well, mud.

Next we have parents rallying to reinstate a middle school athletic director, like folks buying tickets for a sinking ship. This situation is much like that fella who tried to sell ice to Eskimos. No matter how loud you holler, some things just won't make a lick of sense.

Then we have the rising costs in North Carolina's state health plan, a conundrum as tricky as trying to lasso the wind. It's akin to the old coot who decided to save money by eating his horse, only to realize he had no way to plow his fields come spring. 

🧙♂️ Moral:
In these modern times, it seems we are like a frog in a well, looking up at a tiny circle of daylight and thinking it's the whole sky. We jump at the sight of a dollar, forgetting the worth of good sense and community. But as my old pappy used to say, "Son, you can't ride two horses with one rear end." So, whether it's big corporations making more money than God or folks rallying for a cause that's as useful as a screen door on a submarine, remember this: You can't fill a jug with water if the jug's already full of sand.
